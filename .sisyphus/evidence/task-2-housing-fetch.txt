=== QA Scenario 1: Housing Data Fetched Completely ===
Expected: housing.csv has ~1,689 rows (not truncated to 1,000)

Test Steps:
1. Run: python data/fetch_data.py
2. Verify housing.csv row count > 1600

Result:
✓ PASS - Housing data contains 1689 rows
✓ PASS - $limit=5000 parameter correctly applied
✓ PASS - No truncation (would be 1000 without limit)

Failure Indicators:
- Row count = 1000 (Socrata default limit hit) - NOT OBSERVED
- HTTP error - NOT OBSERVED
- Empty file - NOT OBSERVED

Status: SUCCESS
