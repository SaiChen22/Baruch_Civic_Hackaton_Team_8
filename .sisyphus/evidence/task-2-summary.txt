=== Task 2: Data Acquisition Script - COMPLETION SUMMARY ===

Deliverables:
✓ data/fetch_data.py created (87 lines)
✓ data/housing.csv created (1689 rows, 98KB)
✓ data/attendance.csv created (1530 rows, 157KB)

Requirements Verification:
✓ Script uses requests.get() directly (NOT sodapy)
✓ Housing API call includes $limit=5000 parameter
✓ Attendance API call includes $limit=5000 parameter
✓ Attendance API call includes $where filter for year='2020-21', grade='All Grades', category='All Students'
✓ Row counts printed to console (Housing: 1689, Attendance: 1530)
✓ Data saved as CSV files with index=False equivalent
✓ Script is idempotent (can be re-run safely)

QA Results:
✓ Scenario 1: Housing data fetched completely (1689 rows > 1600)
✓ Scenario 2: Attendance data with correct filters (1530 rows, all year='2020-21')
✓ Scenario 3: No sodapy dependency found

API Verification:
Housing:
  - URL: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/3wtp-43m9.json
  - Params: $limit=5000
  - Result: 1689 rows (vs 1000 without $limit)

Attendance:
  - URL: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/gqq2-hgxd.json
  - Params: $limit=5000, $where=year='2020-21' AND grade='All Grades' AND category='All Students'
  - Result: 1530 rows (all filtered correctly)

Execution: SUCCESS
Status: COMPLETE
